3.	Using json.loads() reads the data and using json.get() to get ReviewText as a string. 
4.	The word is extracted from the json string file using split() function and calculates word length.
5.	If the words are greater than or equal to 100 then overall and reviewID is returned else none is returned.
6.	The output of the map function is stored in review.
7.	Filter function is used on the review to remove all the reviews that do not have 100 words i.e to filter out none from the RDD.
8.	Combine by key is used to group all the reviews for every category
